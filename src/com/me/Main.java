//Directions
/*
1) create a new class VipCustomer
2) it should have 3 fields; name, credit limit, and email address
3) create 3 constructors
- 1st constructor empty should call the constructor with 3 parameters
with default value
- 2nd constructor should pass on the 2 values it receives and add a
default value for the 3rd
- 3rd constructor should save all fields
4) create getters only for this using generation of intellij as setter
won't be needed
5) confirm it works
